# ClickFlow — Security Checklist

## Electron Security

- [x] `contextIsolation: true`
- [x] `nodeIntegration: false`
- [x] No `remote` module usage
- [x] No direct `ipcRenderer` exposure in renderer
- [x] CSP header in index.html
- [x] No `eval()` usage
- [x] User text rendered via `textContent` (never `innerHTML`)
- [x] File operations exclusively in main process
- [x] JSON import validated before use
- [x] Settings JSON normalized and validated
- [x] `preload.js` exposes only safe wrappers via `contextBridge`
- [x] No shell commands executed from renderer

## Automation Safety

- [x] Simulation-only execution (no real OS clicks)

- [x] No OCR or image recognition
- [x] No CAPTCHA or anti-bot bypass

- [x] Quit confirmation when execution is running

## Global Hotkeys

- [x] Registered via main process `globalShortcut`
- [x] Unregistered on `will-quit`

## Data Storage

- [x] User data in `app.getPath('userData')` only
- [x] No sensitive data stored

- [x] Export files contain only scenario/settings data

## Packaging
